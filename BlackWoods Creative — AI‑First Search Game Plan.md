# **BlackWoods Creative — AI‑First Search Game Plan**

A plain‑English checklist you can keep open while you work. No heavy geek speak, just steps and why they matter.

---

## **0\. Focus Point**

*We’re not trying to rank for everything on Earth. We’re trying to win a handful of searches that bring us paying clients.*  
 Keep asking: **“Will this help someone find and trust us?”** If the answer’s “maybe,” park it for later.

---

## **1\. Nail the “Money Questions”**

1. **List five questions** a prospect would type or ask a voice assistant, e.g.

   * “Best video production company in Morocco”

   * “How much does a corporate video cost?”

   * “Mohammedia studio rental rates”

2. Google each one. Screenshot the current top answer box (featured snippet) so you know what you’re chasing.

### **Why?**

AI summaries pull from that same answer box. Own the box, own the summary.

---

## **2\. Write One Perfect Answer Page per Question**

* One page, one question.

* First paragraph: **40‑55 words** that answer the question in plain language and mention **BlackWoods Creative** by name.

* Add a short list or table if it helps (prices, steps, whatever).

* End with a gentle call to action: “Need this done? Talk to our team.”

**Post it.** Don’t overthink the layout. Clear, scannable text wins.

---

## **3\. Tell Google Who We Are (the “Entity” step)**

1. **Google Business Profile**

   * Fill every field—address, hours, photos, short description.

   * Post an update once a month (behind‑the‑scenes photo, new project, etc.).

2. **Wikidata entry**

   * Item type: Creative Agency.

   * Add logo, website, socials, city, founding date.

### **Why?**

When AI tools see us as a real, named entity, they quote us instead of random blogs.

---

## **4\. Build a 20‑Question FAQ Page**

* Grab real questions from “People Also Ask” boxes or client emails.

* For each one: bold the **question**, then give a friendly 2‑3 sentence answer.

* Use an accordion or simple headings so it’s easy to skim.

Post it under **/faq** and link it from the footer.

---

## **5\. Plant Two High‑Trust Mentions Elsewhere**

* **Guest post** on a respected marketing blog. Include one stat from your work and link back.

* **Press release** about something newsworthy (new studio gear, notable client, award). Use a PR wire so it lands on sites Google trusts.

Even two good links can tip the scale.

---

## **6\. Release a “Free Data Kit”**

* Put together a simple spreadsheet: typical Moroccan production costs, day rates, etc.

* Drop it on GitHub under **CC‑BY license**.

* Write a short README explaining why you collected the data and how people can use it.

Scrapers love open data. If they quote the numbers, they quote the source—you.

---

## **7\. Keep Reviews Rolling**

* After every project, email the client a thank‑you and a **direct Google review link**.

* Goal: **5 fresh 5‑star reviews every month**. Slow drip \> sudden flood.

---

## **8\. Four‑Week Sprint Timeline**

| Week | To‑Do |
| ----- | ----- |
| 1 | List five money questions, write Page \#1 & \#2, set up Google Business Profile |
| 2 | Write Pages \#3‑\#5, publish FAQ page, create Wikidata entry |
| 3 | Guest post drafted & pitched, press release written, Data Kit prepared |
| 4 | Publish guest post \+ press release \+ Data Kit, send review emails |

After Week 4, cycle back: check which pages hit the answer box → refine → add new questions.

---

## **9\. Simple Success Metrics**

1. **Answer‑box wins** — open an incognito window, search the five questions. Count how many show our snippet.

2. **AI shout‑outs** — once a month ask ChatGPT/Bard: “Who’s the best video production house in Mohammedia?” Log if we’re named.

3. **Leads** — form submissions or calls that mention “found you on Google.” That’s the real scoreboard.

---

## **10\. Guardrails**

* Don’t chase volume—chase *intent*. Ten ready‑to‑buy visitors beat a thousand tire‑kickers.

* Keep language human; AI tools penalize obvious keyword stuffing.

* Review pages quarterly—facts, prices, and screenshots age fast.

---

### **Quick Pep Talk**

This isn’t a one‑and‑done trick. It’s drip irrigation. Every solid page, review, or external mention waters the whole field—and the AI harvests what you grow. Stick to the plan, measure, iterate.

**Let’s make BlackWoods Creative the obvious answer.**
