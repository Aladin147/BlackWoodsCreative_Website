- [ ] Implement CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Create project contribution guidelines

### Monitoring
- [ ] Integrate Lighthouse CI
- [ ] Setup performance budgets
- [ ] Add error tracking (Sentry)
- [ ] Implement real user monitoring (RUM)

## 5. User Experience Enhancements (Phase 5 - 3 Weeks)
### Modern Features
- [ ] Implement view transitions API
- [ ] Add web animations API
- [ ] Create offline capability with service workers
- [ ] Add web share functionality

### Theme Refinements
- [x] Updated primary color to pastel green
- [x] Implemented SVG logo in header
- [x] Implemented dark mode toggle UI (light theme pending)
- [x] Implemented theme-aware component system
- [x] Added theme switching animation

### Interaction Design
- [ ] Implement loading states for section transitions
- [ ] Add subtle sound effects for interactions
- [ ] Create progressive disclosure patterns
- [ ] Enhance micro-interactions

## 6. Maintenance Plan
- **Monthly**: Performance audits and dependency updates
- **Quarterly**: Accessibility compliance checks
- **Biannual**: Security penetration testing
- **Annual**: Full UX review and redesign planning

## üö® EMERGENCY NEXT STEPS - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### **CRITICAL (Next 24 Hours)**
1. **STOP all non-critical development work**
2. **Fix 9 ESLint errors** to enable production builds
3. **Begin HomePage test audit** - identify all fake implementations
4. **Start component-test alignment** - verify what components actually render

### **HIGH PRIORITY (Next 48 Hours)**
1. **Complete fake test removal** and rewrite with authentic implementations
2. **Add missing browser API mocks** for performance tests
3. **Update component implementations** to match test expectations
4. **Verify build stability** and consistent results

### **MEDIUM PRIORITY (Next Week)**
1. **Complete comprehensive test suite audit**
2. **Implement proper test infrastructure**
3. **Establish quality gates** to prevent future fake implementations
4. **Document authentic testing standards**

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING**: Do not proceed with any Phase 2+ items until Phase 0 and Phase 1 are completely resolved. The codebase integrity must be restored before any optimization or enhancement work.
